Over the years I have had so many ideas that I forgot to do something about so I made my self a promise to write them down.
Here's a list of my notes about ideas and projects I'm currently working on.

You could also checkout my [github repo](https://github.com/danielkaldheim/my-public-notes) for my public notes.

- [How to use ADC of ESP32 â€“ Measuring voltage example](https://microcontrollerslab.com/adc-esp32-measuring-voltage-example/)

### IAQ - BSEC

[BSEC documentation](./lib/BSEC-Arduino-library/README.md)

**IAQ Accuracy=0** could either mean:

BSEC was just started, and the sensor is stabilizing (this lasts normally 5min in LP mode or 20min in ULP mode),
there was a timing violation (i.e. BSEC was called too early or too late), which should be indicated by a warning/error flag by BSEC,

**IAQ Accuracy=1** means the background history of BSEC is uncertain. This typically means the gas sensor data was too stable for BSEC to clearly define its references,

**IAQ Accuracy=2** means BSEC found a new calibration data and is currently calibrating,

**IAQ Accuracy=3** means BSEC calibrated successfully.

### JSON

For next revision: i2c microphone

![ESP i2s](../../images/projects/crudus-sense/images/esp32-i2s-slm-bp.svg)

```cpp
float spl = ( 20 * log( adcMax - adcMin )) + 35.13;
```

#### Components

##### MAX9814

The MAX9814 is a low-cost, high-quality microphone amplifier with automatic gain control (AGC) and low-noise microphone bias.

- [Datasheet](https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX9814.pdf)

###### Note

Pin 14, **TH**: AGC Threshold Control. TH voltage sets gain control threshold. Connect TH to MICBIAS to disable
the AGC. To disable AGC we can remove resistor **R20** and **R19**, and solder a bridge between the pads on **R19**.

##### CMA-4544PF-W

Electret condenser microphone.

### Light

Alternative to LDR is a BH1750 chip. This is for next revision?.

- [BH1750 Digital Light Sensor](https://www.instructables.com/id/BH1750-Digital-Light-Sensor/)
- [Design a Luxmeter Using a Light Dependent Resistor](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/projects/design-a-luxmeter-using-a-light-dependent-resistor/)

Measure EV -> Lux with [Sekonic Flashmate](https://www.sekonic.com/sites/sekonic.com/files/Manuals/L-308S/l-308s_english.pdf) and find coefficients with the calculator used to find dB coefficient.

#### How to use an incident illuminance (LUX or FC) meter

[EV - Exposure value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_value)

![Sekonic Lumidisc](../../images/projects/crudus-sense/images/sekonic-Lumidisc.jpg)

1. Mount the Lumidisc accessory
2. Set EV mode and ISO 100.
3. Measure with the area to be measured parallel to the Lumidisc.
4. Determine the illuminance (lux) from the calculation table using the measured
EV.

##### EV Value -> Lux conversion table
